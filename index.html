                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>G'day! I'm Seb, and I've spent the last 15 years on a mission to prove that enterprise software doesn't have to feel like... well, enterprise software. You know the type - clunky, confusing, and designed by someone who clearly never has to use it.</p>
                    <p>My journey started with a Bachelor of Interactive Entertainment in Animation (yes, really!), which probably explains why I'm obsessed with making business software that people actually <em>want</em> to use. After stints in game QA and running a photo centre, I discovered my calling: solving complex business problems with elegant tech solutions.</p>
                    <p>These days, I'm the General Manager at Octfolio, where we help organisations across Australia and New Zealand manage hazardous materials compliance without wanting to tear their hair out. I've had the privilege of working with everyone from poultry producers (saving them $1M+ annually) to power companies (96% error reduction!), always with the same goal: making their work lives easier.</p>
                    <p>I'm particularly proud of building remote teams before it was trendy (been doing it since 2016!), creating a partner program that help drive revenue, and most importantly, fostering a culture where my team genuinely enjoys Monday mornings. That last one might be my greatest achievement.</p>
